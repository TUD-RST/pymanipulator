# pymanipulator

This repository contains code associated with the paper *"Maneuver-based control of the 2-degrees of freedom underactuated manipulator in normal form coordinates"*
([Link](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21642583.2014.984358)).

The code is written in Python 2.7.
It depends on the packages `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib` which do all ship with python distributions like
[winpython](http://winpython.github.io/) or [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda)


To run the default maneuver use the command `python main_maneuver_control.py`.
This file can be easily adapted to perform other equilibrium transitions.
